2. **Database Setup:**
   - Install WAMP or XAMPP.
   - For WAMP: Navigate to the `www` folder inside the WAMP installation directory.
     For XAMPP: Navigate to the `htdocs` folder inside the XAMPP installation directory.
   - Create a folder named `crud-operation`.
   - Import the `emp.sql` file into your MySQL database. This file contains the necessary table structure for the project.

3. **Connection Configuration:**
   - Open the `connection.php` file located in the `crud-operation` folder.
   - Update the following variables with your database credentials:
     - `$server`: The hostname of your MySQL server (usually "localhost").
     - `$username`: Your MySQL username.
     - `$password`: Your MySQL password.
     - `$database`: The name of the MySQL database where the student records will be stored.

### Step 2: Running the Application

1. **Starting the Server:**
   - Start WAMP or XAMPP server.

2. **Accessing the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/crud-operation`.

### Step 3: Using the Application

     - City
     - Email
     - Phone
     - Department (Work Type)
     - Address
   - Click on the "Submit" button to add the record to the database.

2. **Viewing Data:**

   - Each record will display the following information:
     - ID (auto-generated by the database)
     - Name
     - Age
     - Gender
     - City
     - Email
     - Phone
     - Department
     - Address
   - You can see options to delete and update records in the table.

3. **Updating Data:**
   - Click on the "Edit" icon next to the record you want to update.
   - Update the information in the form and click on the "Update Record" button.

4. **Deleting Data:**
   - Click on the "Delete" icon next to the record you want to delete.

### Step 4: Additional Notes

- **File Structure:**
  - `connection.php`: PHP file for database connection.
  - `again.php`: PHP file for inserting data.
  - `index.php`: PHP file for displaying student records.
  - `update.php`: PHP file for updating records.
  - `update_process.php`: PHP file for processing record updates.
